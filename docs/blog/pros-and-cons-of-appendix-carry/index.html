<p>Appendix carry positions the firearm up front, typically between the 12 and 1 o&rsquo;clock positions. The advantages include a faster draw and better concealment for some body types. It&rsquo;s also easier to keep an eye on your firearm in crowded areas.</p>
<p>However, appendix carry can be uncomfortable while sitting and may present safety concerns if the trigger is not adequately covered. Always use a holster with full trigger protection and practice proper draw techniques to minimize risk.</p>

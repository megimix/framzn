<p>Hot weather makes concealed carry challenging, but the right gear can help. Look for breathable holsters with sweat guards to protect both you and your firearm. Lightweight cover garments such as untucked button-down shirts offer good concealment without trapping heat.</p>
<p>If you find waist carry uncomfortable in the heat, consider alternative methods like pocket carry in a proper pocket holster. Whatever you choose, ensure the trigger remains fully covered for safety.</p>

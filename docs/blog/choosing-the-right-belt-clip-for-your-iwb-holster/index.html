<p>Belt clips come in a variety of materials and shapes, each affecting how securely your holster attaches and how well it stays hidden. Steel clips are strong but can be bulky, while polymer clips are lightweight and less prone to scratching your belt.</p>
<p>Look for clips that match the width of your belt and offer enough tension to keep the holster in place during vigorous movement. Some holsters also offer soft loops for extra security. Test different clip styles to find the one that balances comfort and concealability for your needs.</p>

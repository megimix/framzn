<p>Concealed carry with a tucked shirt is all about minimizing printing and keeping your draw accessible. Start with a holster specifically designed to be tuckable. Wear a sturdy belt, and place the clips as far apart as comfortable to reduce movement.</p>
<p>Practice your draw slowly at first, focusing on sweeping the shirt up and establishing a solid grip on your firearm. With repetition, the motion will feel natural. Remember that a loose-fitting shirt provides more room to conceal your holster and reduces the chance of printing.</p>

<p>Before purchasing a tuckable holster, verify that it&rsquo;s molded specifically for your handgun model. A proper fit covers the trigger guard completely and holds the firearm without excessive play.</p>
<p>Some holster manufacturers offer shells that accommodate multiple models with similar frames. When in doubt, consult the manufacturer&rsquo;s fit chart or contact their support team. A holster that fits well is crucial for safe carry and reliable retention.</p>

Most tuckable holsters allow adjustments to cant and retention so you can personalize how the gun sits and how tightly it holds. To adjust cant, loosen the screws holding the clip and rotate the holster to your preferred angle, then retighten.

Retention screws control how tightly the holster clamps the firearm. Turn them in small increments until you feel a secure hold that still allows a clean draw. Spend time experimenting at home to find the setup that feels natural and keeps your firearm secure.

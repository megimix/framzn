Appendix carry positions the firearm up front, typically between the 12 and 1 o'clock positions. The advantages include a faster draw and better concealment for some body types. It's also easier to keep an eye on your firearm in crowded areas.

However, appendix carry can be uncomfortable while sitting and may present safety concerns if the trigger is not adequately covered. Always use a holster with full trigger protection and practice proper draw techniques to minimize risk.

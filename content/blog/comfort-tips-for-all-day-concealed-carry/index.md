Carrying for long hours can be uncomfortable if your holster digs into your side or shifts around. Choose a holster with smooth edges and, if possible, a sweat guard to keep moisture away from your firearm.

Adjust your belt so the holster is snug but not overly tight. Consider wearing an undershirt to create a barrier between the holster and your skin. Rotating your carry position slightly from time to time can also alleviate hot spots throughout the day.

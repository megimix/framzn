A well-designed holster completely covers the trigger guard, preventing accidental discharge while carrying or reholstering. Avoid flimsy cloth holsters that can collapse and touch the trigger.

Before holstering, make sure nothing—such as drawstrings or loose clothing—can get between the holster and trigger. Good trigger protection allows you to carry confidently and safely in daily life.

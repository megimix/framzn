Kydex holsters are durable, but they still require occasional maintenance. Wipe down the surfaces with a damp cloth to remove sweat and debris. Avoid leaving the holster in extreme heat, which can warp the material.

Check your hardwareâ€”screws and clips can loosen over time. Apply a small amount of thread locker if necessary. By keeping your Kydex holster clean and properly adjusted, you'll ensure consistent retention and smooth draws.

# Framzn

This repository contains the source for the Framzn static site. The site is
generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the output is stored in the
`docs` directory so it can be published using GitHub Pages.

To regenerate the site after making changes run:

```bash
hugo
```

Hugo will use the configuration in `hugo.toml` and place the generated files in
`docs/`.
